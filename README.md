# MMVGM 

This repository contains code for fake video detection, fake video source tracing, and misuse prevention tasks. We have proposed the first pipeline against the misuse and unsafe concern for video diffusion models.

This module contains:

1. Codes for trained detection and source tracing models with given data.
2. Approaches to use our misuse prevention strategy.
