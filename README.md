# MMVGM 

This repository contains code for *fake video detection*, *fake video source tracing*, and *misuse prevention* tasks. We have proposed the first pipeline against the misuse and unsafe concern for video diffusion models.

This module contains:

1. Codes for trained detection and source tracing models with given data.
2. Approaches to use our misuse prevention strategy.
